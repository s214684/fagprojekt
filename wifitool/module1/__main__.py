# Get SSIDS in wifi medium (scan network)

# Choose one SSID to emulate - e.g. based on WPA2, name, number of clients connected to it

# Can we crack the key in order to create our own AP? if not go to next..

# Create rogue AP with same SSID+key

# Send beacon frames where we look like good AP (but we are the bad AP)

# De-auth clients connected to SSID

# Let clients connect to our rogue AP
