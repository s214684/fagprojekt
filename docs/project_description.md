# Project description



## Product brainstorm

· General:
    
    - RaspberryPi Pineapple, "WiFi swiss army knife".

    - Man in the middle.

    - Checks the wifis in the area, and displays them with multiple functionalities.

    - Sniff all wireless traffic.

    - Recognise difference between traffic types:
        probe messages, 4-way-handshakes, 




· Required functionalities:

    - Listening for wireless data.

    - Identifying sendes and recieveres of said data
    
    - Scanning for routers and AP's in the area.
    
    - Gaining access to network card, read from it and send to it. (windows and macOS complications??)
    




· Possible extra functionalities:

    - Tracking people in the area(recognises mac addresse, and how long they have been known).

    - FHSS(see which band is used).

    - Distance from user to pruduct (triangulation).

    - Implement a 4-way-handshake.
        able to connect to an AP.
        Possible using an existing library.
    
    - Reinstallation attack.

    - Password cracking.

    - Encryption/Decryption (possible out of the scope of the project).
    
    - Deauthenticating users.
